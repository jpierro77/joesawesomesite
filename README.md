# JoesAwesomeSite

JoesAwesomesite is a simple django site with purpose of providing a visible demonstration of my web development knowledge
and skill. The site currently contains two apps, RankLists and CalorieCounter, and also features contains account
creation and management features.

## RankLists
RankLists allows users to list some of their favorite items of a certain topic, can be books, movies, foods etc.,
and assists the user to ranking the items without much thought. Users are then able to submit pictures of their lists to twitter. The user can also make lists that anyone can add items to
and vote on.

### Use help:
The first box displays the RankList, and the second box is for creation of the Ranklist. The Ranklist is given a title and a type of either Personal, or Master List, and then the last input are items that
are added into the list.

### Personal Lists
These are lists that only one user (the creator of the list) can add items to and vote on. After the user adds their items to the list, they can click the Start Vote button and vote between
each item compared with every other one in the list. Personal lists are able to be shared to twitter.

### Master Lists
These are lists that one user initially creates and adds items to, and then any user is allowed to add items to the list, and vote afterward.




## Calories

Calories app allows users to track their food's calories against either a daily
limit or requirement (depending on goal). Users can click on a calendar and add and edit foods they have consumed for that day. Then daily calorie
limit calculations are made and displayed.

### Health Profile:
The first box is a health profile, which calculates the user's BMR(Basal Metabolic Rate) and daily calorie limits based on their height, weight, age, gender, physical activity level,
and weekly weight gain and loss goal.

### Calendar:
The second box is a calendar where the user that allows users to click on dates and add foods that they have consumed to that day. The daily calories are added up, recorded, saved and displayed for
each date the user adds foods to.

## User Accounts
In order to fully use all of the features of the site, such as saving RankLists and tracking daily food consumption, users can set up accounts. Only username and passwords are required to make these 
accounts, they are then able to customize a profile page as well.
